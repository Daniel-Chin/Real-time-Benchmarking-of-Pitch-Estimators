insights {
    Why reject f and favor 2f? The absence of 3f. 
        cepstrum got this!
        Looks like Subharmonic to Harmonic Ratio (SHR) also got it.
            "recognize the pitch of inharmonic signals": is it necessary for human pitch? ["SHAPE"]
    Common problem:
        F1 is stronger than F0

    bubble peak calling:
        it's like bubble-sort: iterate everything once, and every bubble moved. 
        Bubble has inertia. Y-axis delta adds energy to the bubble.

    Spectral leak:
        tends to 0 as window gets larger. use this?
            use processing to make a spectral leakage visualizer.
            Seperate project! 
            Done! 
    My SFT:
        SFT part is more efficient than I thought
        Processing visualizer conclusion:
            Good for "a" and "i", bad for "o", "u", and "v". 
            Not stable enough. Even eyeballing fails
    Holistic way of estimating how much away from 12-tone?
